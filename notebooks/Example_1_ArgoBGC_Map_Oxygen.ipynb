    "### Example 1 - Map of dissolved oxygen content in the North West Atlantic\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to read and manipulate Argo observations in parquet format. The data are stored across multiple files: we will load into memory only what we need by applying some filters, and we will create a map showing the dissolved oxygen measurements in the North West Atlantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Example 1 shows how to use the full Argo dataset built from profile files (more details:). Example 2 shows how to use CrocoLake, which contains QCed data from different datasets (Argo, GLODAP, Spray Gliders as of today).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note on parquet files\n",
    "There are several ways to load parquet files in a dataframe in Python, and this notebook shows two of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pandas + pyarrow: this approach uses the pyarrow package to load the data into a pandas dataframe;\n",
    "2. dask (+ pandas + pyarrow): this approach uses the dask package to load the data into a dask dataframe; it uses pandas and pyarrow under the hood, and a dask dataframe is (almost) identical to a pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first use pyarrow to load the dataset, so that we can provide a target schema (containing the Argo variable names) and load the data consistently across floats, independently of what variables each float actually has. We will finally convert the dataset to a pandas dataframe for manipulation and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other ways to read parquet files are by using pandas (make sure you have pyarrow, fastparquet or some other suitable engine installed), and Dask. Generally speaking, you'll want to use Dask only if you need a large amount of data at the same time so that you can benefit from its parallelization. You should avoid Dask whenever the data fits in your RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "When reading parquet files with pyarrow (or pandas), you can either specificy the file name(s), or the directory containing all the parquet files. In latter case if you apply any filter, pandas and pyarrow will sort through all the files in the folder, reading into memory only the subsets that satisfy your filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, install the required packages by running `pip install .` at the root of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need the dataset! In this example we use the Argo BGC dataset: you can uncomment and run the cell below, or copy-paste the command (without the leading `!`) in your command line. If you are interested in physical quantities only, you can replace 'BGC' with 'PHY' here and throughout the notebook."
